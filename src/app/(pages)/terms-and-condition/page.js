                Binding Arbitration

            <p className="body-default mb-6 text-nomadory-primary">
                In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to
                the Terms, the Website, the Nomadory Products and
                Services, or any other products or services provided by
                Nomadory, LLC (each, a "Dispute"), either party may
                elect to finally and exclusively resolve the dispute by
                binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration
                Act (FAA). Any election to arbitrate, at any time,
                shall be final and binding on the other party. IF EITHER
                PARTY CHOOSES ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE
                RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY
                TRIAL. DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED
                IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be resolved before a
                neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except
                for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. Any court
                in the State of New York may enforce the arbitrator's
                award. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted
                under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
                Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate,
                the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related
                Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are
                available at the AAA website www.adr.org. The
                arbitration may be conducted in person, through the
                submission of documents, by phone or online. If
                conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in
                the State of New York. The parties may litigate in court
                to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending
                arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter
                judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. In
                addition, we may litigate in court to seek injunctive
                relief.
